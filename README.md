# NeuroStim_CurrentGenerator
This is associated code for a Matlab based user interface to send parameters to a Teensy microcontroller to work as a function generator. The experimentalist can update these parameters on-the-fly, for trial-by-trial modifications to the stimulus. Requires a headstage amplifier set to voltage clamp mode, using the gate input for the digital pulse for depolarizing pulses, or mid stimulus pulse.

Version 1 and 2 have been tested experimentally in the laboratory setting with mice. Work left to do is to clean up the code and continue to increase flexibility. Lab_Versions directory is not fully populated with devices used in the lab. 

Developed for the MageeLab in Houston
